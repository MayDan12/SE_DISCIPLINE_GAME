What is Recursion?
-Recursion in programming is a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. Instead of solving the entire problem at once, the function breaks it down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. These sub-problems are solved by calling the same function, and the results are combined to obtain the solution to the original problem.

Involvement of a Function Calling Itself:
-In a recursive function, the function calls itself during its execution. This self-referential behavior allows the function to solve a more complex problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem. Each recursive call contributes to breaking down the problem into simpler parts until a base case is reached.

Basic Idea of Breaking Down a Problem into Smaller Sub-Problems:
-The basic idea behind recursion is to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Each recursive call works on a smaller instance of the original problem, making the problem-solving process more straightforward. The recursion continues until a base case is met, at which point the function stops calling itself and starts to combine the results obtained from the smaller sub-problems.
