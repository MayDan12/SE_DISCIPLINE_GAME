# SE_DISCIPLINE_GAME
This is a consistency and discipline in which we post progress of our software Engineering learning

Let's go over the plan for our collaborative learning
Treating this as a game, we'll engage in active coding for minimum hours daily, challenging ourselves to reach new heights. However, every game has its rules, and here are ours:

1. Strictly follow instructions to avoid elimination. No excusesâ€”just get the task done as instructed.
2. Weekly eliminations will occur based on performance, with at least two individuals exiting each time. They can rejoin the game after two months.
3. Eliminations continue until the final five participants, who will collaborate on a real-life project.
4. If you feel you lack the discipline to continue, communicate with us for a voluntary elimination.
5. Mutual assistance is vital. Respond to questions or project queries promptly, and failure to do so may lead to elimination.

Now, onto the main activities:

- Week One: Master a significant concept with daily progress logs. Failure to do so results in eviction.
- Week Two: Swap concepts with an assigned partner and master their concepts 
- Week Three: Collaboratively build a project/tasks assigned to you using the mastered concept with your partner 
- Week Four: Self-assessment, and the last standing individuals will commence working on a joint project.

During this period, I'll be checking your GitHub and Twitter accounts to ensure you're updating the public on your progress. Missing a day may lead to eviction.

This outlines our initial plan. I'll comm
